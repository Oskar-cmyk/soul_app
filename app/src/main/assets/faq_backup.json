    "content": "SOUL is a tool that allows you to change (mock) your GPS data, enabled by Developed Options. When you set SOUL as the “mock location app” in Developer Options section in your settings, it provides a this augmented GPS signal to the entire system, meaning all apps on your phone will receive that signal and locate you on Null Island."

    "title": "Why does the location sometime ‘jump’?",
    "content": "Modern phones use a ‘fused’ location from GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks. If SOUL GPS signal strongly disagrees with other network data, the system might briefly ‘jump’ to your physical location. SOUL tries to minimize this, but occasional ‘jumps’ still occur. To minimize this, you may want to turn off your Wi-Fi or set your phone to Airplane mode."
